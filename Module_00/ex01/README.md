## 80s Phonebook

Welcome to the 80s and their unbelievable technology! This project is a fun take on a retro-style phonebook program that behaves like an awesome (or maybe a bit crappy) piece of software from that era.

### Overview

The goal is to create a simple phonebook program with two main classes:

### Classes

- **PhoneBook**
  - Holds an array of contacts.
  - Can store a maximum of 8 contacts. If the user attempts to add a 9th contact, the oldest contact will be replaced with the new one.
  - Note: Dynamic memory allocation is forbidden.

- **Contact**
  - Represents a phonebook contact.

### Implementation Details

- The phonebook should be created as an instance of the `PhoneBook` class.
- Each contact should be created as an instance of the `Contact` class.
- You're free to design the classes as you wish, but remember:
  - Anything that is always used inside a class should be `private`.
  - Anything that can be used outside a class should be `public`.

### Getting Started

This program is a great way to practice basic C++ concepts such as classes, encapsulation, and static memory management. It's also a nostalgic trip back to the days when technology was simpler, yet still fascinating!
