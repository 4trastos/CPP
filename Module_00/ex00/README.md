## Just to make sure that everybody is awake, write a program that behaves as follows:

$>./megaphone "shhhhh... I think the students are asleep..."
SHHHHH... I THINK THE STUDENTS ARE ASLEEP...
$>./megaphone Damnit " ! " "Sorry students, I thought this thing was off."
DAMNIT ! SORRY STUDENTS, I THOUGHT THIS THING WAS OFF.
$>./megaphone
* LOUD AND UNBEARABLE FEEDBACK NOISE *
