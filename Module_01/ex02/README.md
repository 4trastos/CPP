# Pointer and Reference Exercise

## Objective

Write a program that contains:
- A string variable initialized to `"HI THIS IS BRAIN"`.
- `stringPTR`: A pointer to the string.
- `stringREF`: A reference to the string.

## Program Requirements

Your program has to print:
- The memory address of the string variable.
- The memory address held by `stringPTR`.
- The memory address held by `stringREF`.

And then:
- The value of the string variable.
- The value pointed to by `stringPTR`.
- The value pointed to by `stringREF`.

## Purpose

Thatâ€™s all, no tricks. The goal of this exercise is to demystify references which can seem completely new. Although there are some little differences, this is another syntax for something you already do: address manipulation.
